create a variable that will take in the value of the word that was input by user
    -- MAKE SURE THAT ENTER ALSO WORKS AS A KEY PRESS

when submit button is clicked, hide the submit button and show a new input field that will allow the user guesses
create a flex box for divs
create a single line of code that creates a div (with a border and size x X x)
create a for loop that will generate as many divs in a flexbox as in word.length
allow user to guess while less than word.length

create display box with remaining guesses
then worry about hang man picture
