This is a traditional game of hangman without the "hanging" stick figure. It seems to be slightly controversial in some circles.

- The game requires two players
  - First player one enters a word
  - Then player two enters one letter at a time while there are still sufficient guesses remaining.
  - upon completion ( guessing word or running out of guesses ) use the reset button to start a new game.
